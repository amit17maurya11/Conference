      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p className='about-para'>The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is undergoing a rapid transformation
due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and the widespread
adoption of the Transformer architecture. As educators and researchers, we find
ourselves at a crossroads: how should we rethink the way NLP is taught to better align
with these developments? Should the focus shift away from traditional methods, and if
so, which concepts remain valuable? In an academic context, especially in Indian
universities with a rich linguistic diversity, how do we ensure that the modern NLP
curriculum reflects not just global trends but also the unique challenges of Indian
languages?
<br/>
<br/>
This workshop proposes to explore these questions and help educators think critically
about what the future of NLP education should look like.</p>
